# BRIFSverification

This is documentation for BRIFS system verification Python tools. These tools allow us to operationaly (daily) compare BRIFS system outputs with all available in situ data from SOCIB observational network and plot high-quality images of comparisons. (Adapting the tool to be used for operational WMOP verification should also be straightforward.)
